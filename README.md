# A WebPop library for the Pusher API based on [node-pusher](https://github.com/crossbreeze/node-pusher "node-pusher")
What's [WebPop](http://www.webpop.com/ "Cloud CMS for Designers")?

## How to use from a WebPop extension
```javascript
var Pusher = require('./extensions/webpop-pusher/pusher');

var pusher = Pusher.create({
    appId: 'YOUR_PUSHER_APP_ID',
    key: 'YOUR_PUSHER_APP_KEY',
    secret: 'YOUR_PUSHER_SECRET_KEY'
});

var channel = 'test_channel';
var event = 'my_event';
var data = {
    "hello": "world"
};

// (optional) socket_id is used to prevent getting message for myself
// http://pusher.com/docs/publisher_api_guide/publisher_excluding_recipients
var socket_id = '1302.1081607';

pusher.trigger(channel, event, data, socket_id, function(err, req, res) {
    // do something (this callback is optional)
});

// auth function returns the object with the auth field which can be returned from our sever
// to authorize the socket to subscribe to a private or presence channel
// http://pusher.com/docs/auth_signatures
pusher.auth(socket_id, channel, data);
```
